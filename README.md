# freeCodeCamp Tracker DEPRECATED 

**FreecodeCamp moved to using React which prevents the application from scraping the web contents.  However, this project still serves as an example of a full stack Clojure project.**


I built this tool in order to track the progress of FreeCodeCamp. If you are in an organization
that is using FreeCodeCamp as supplementary material, and you want a view into everyone's progress.
This is the perfect tool for you.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.0 or above installed.
